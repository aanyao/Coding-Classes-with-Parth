Functions are created using def keyword
def <name of the function>(<argument>)
  # write what function does
  return <output from the function>

For example: Write a function that takes a number as an argument and return its square:
def myfunc(num):
  return num**2

Write a function that prints "Hello World"
def myfunc(): # does not take any argument
  print("hello world") #does not have a return statement
