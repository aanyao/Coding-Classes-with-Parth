Suppose you have to create a list of all even numbers from 0 to 10. One way is:

for i in range(11):
  if i%2==0:
    print(i)

Another way could be:
print([x for x in range(11) if x%2==0])

Later, is called list comprehension. 

Another Example: Suppose temperature is given in celcius and you need to convert it into fahernheit:

celcius = list(range(20,40,5)) #generates list of temperature in celcius 
fahrenheit = [((9/5)*temp + 32) for temp in celcius] #generates list of temperature in fahrenheit
