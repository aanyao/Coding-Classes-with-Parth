// To declare a variable in Java, you need to specify the data type as well. For instance, 
int a = 5; 
// In python you can simply say :
a = 5

// In Java once  a variable is declared, it doesn't store any other type of variable. For instance,
int a = 5;
String a = "Sammy"; // This will throw error
a = 7; // This will work because data type remains integer


char a = 'D'; // Character is another data type in Java that stores only a single letter. It has single quotes. 
int b = 7; // Integer is a data type that stores whole number
String c = "Sammy"; // String holds a word or a sentence in double quotes

//In Java every statement ends with ;

//In order to print something in Java following code is used

class HelloWorld {
    public static void main (String args[]) {
    System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}

// Every program in Java starts with a class
// Notice the use of curly brackets
