#Variables make it easy to call data again and again at multiple places 


Dynamic Typing

My_dog = 2
My_dog = [“Sammy”, “Frankie”]

Value of My_dog can be changed in python unlike C++

Data Types

Integer
1,2,3, etc are integer
A = 1
B = 2
A + B = 3
A*B = 2
A - B = -1
A/B = 0.5 

Float
1.5, 3.52, etc are float values i.e. value with decimals

String
Within single or double quotes
‘Sammy’
“Hello” 

A = ‘Sammy’  #Stores value of string 

Indexing of String

A[0] = ‘S’       #Returns first character of string 
A[1] = ‘a’       #Returns second character
A[-1] = ‘y’      #Returns last character
A[-2] = ‘m’	#Returns second last character

String Slicing

A[1:3] = ‘am’  #Starts from second character and counts up to third character
A[1:] = ‘ammy’ #Starts from second all way to last
A[::2] = ‘Smy’  #Jumps two characters

Concatenation
B = ‘Hello’
A + B = ‘SammyHello’
‘Python %s’ % ‘Rules!’
‘2’ + ‘3’ = 23

Methods
A = “My name is Parth”
A.split() = [“My”, “name”, “is”, “Parth”]
A.split(‘a’) = [“My n”, “me is P”, “rth”]
print(‘My name is {}’.format(‘Parth’)) 
print(‘My name is {} {}’.format(‘Parth’, ‘Loya’))
